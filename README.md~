Simple ToDo-app done in Flutter  
30.05.2021  

Working:

    View ToDo     
    Add ToDo  
    Edit ToDo  
    Change ToDo state  
    Delete Todo  
      
Not working:  

    No database or local saving. Tried, but just no.  
    Current status of ToDo doesn't default into edit mode.  
    Pressing back button confuses the tabs.  
  
Things that 'work' but need to be much better:  

    Instead of remaking filtered list for every tab everytime tab changes, should do only when necessary.
    Cleaner code, everywhere.  
    Breaking into smaller pieces for better readability and maintanence.  
    Remove unnecessary dependencies.  
    Re-think provider stuff.
